# Data Science Specialisation - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The repository contians R-code, which is written to extract data and then read and manipulate to get the desired output.

The data set being used is:Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
# About the files
The code takes for all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered. The data is automatically downloaded and unzipped in the working directory. for the code to run successfully, the working directory has to be set and the code modified accordingly (I mean the path).

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
